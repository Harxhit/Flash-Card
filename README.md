# Flash Card âš¡
## Project Description:
I developed an interactive flashcard application using Python, tkinter, and pandas, designed to facilitate effective language learning with support for both English and French. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface where users can create, review, and manage flashcards seamlessly. Utilizing pandas for efficient data management ensures smooth storage and retrieval of card content.
